    h1.title About us
    p.block We all have that box of things we never use. Items we saved for that perfect moment that never came. Sometimes we outgrow the things we love, or no longer need the things we once wanted.
    p.block  Freestuff is a platform for those of us whose instinct to hoard or throw can come easier than to give. We hope to provide a fuss-free experience where your good quality items can find a new forever home, for free.
    p.block This is your online space without judgment. We will ensure that those who need the items most, can get the first dibs. But if no one needs it and someone wants it, let them have it. And if no one needs it nor wants it, you can dispose of it guilt-free. 
    p.block Overtime we hope that  Freestuff can help break the cycle of commercial waste and excess. We see this as a small step towards a more equal and compassionate Singapore, where the gap between the haves and have nots is narrowed.

    h1.title Who are we
    p.block We are a team of public officers from Open Government Products (OGP) deeply committed to building a more equal society. We hope that  Freestuff will help you to take that first step with us. Discover a marketplace to give and take, freely. The only currency here is compassion. Contact us at #[a(href="mailto:freestuff@open.gov.sg") freestuff@open.gov.sg] with any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.
    
    h1.title Frequently Asked Questions

    h2.title What is Hackathon?
    p Hack for Public Good is an annual fixture of OGP’s way of work to keep us identifying and working on building tech to deliver public good. Read more about it #[a(href="https://hack.gov.sg/") here].

    h2.title What does it mean for  Freestuff to be a Prototype?
    p.block As a prototype,  Freestuff represents a minimum viable product (MVP) with only the critical functions. With your support and interest, we hope that this prototype built as part of OGP’s Hack for Public Good 2023 can become a long-term reality with additional features. 

    h2.title Why must I use sgID and SingPass?
    p.block This enables users to register quickly but securely, and be reassured that they are interacting with ‘real’ people on the other side.
    p.block sgID employs end-to-end encryption, and does not store any of your data that passes through our servers. We are not tracking what you give or take here. Even in the case of a data breach, your data will never be compromised because it remains safely on your phone, in your control.

    h2.title What about delivery?
    p.block We understand that the logistics of give-and-take can be challenging. As we further develop this platform we hope to offer sensible delivery options to support our moneyless marketplace. In the meantime, we request that you make your own arrangements to give or take any items listed on  Freestuff.
    p.block If you are a logistics company interested in collaborating with  Freestuff, please contact us at #[a(href="mailto:freestuff@open.gov.sg") freestuff@open.gov.sg] to discuss options.
