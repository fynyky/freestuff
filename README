## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Install Docker Desktop
- Install VS Code
- Install TablePlus

### Setup Docker Dev Environment
In Docker Desktop, create a Dev Environment using the existing git repo URL (https://github.com/fynyky/freestuff).
Open the `app` container in VSCode from Docker Dev, then enter the `app` folder.

```sh
cd app
```

Install the necessary NodeJS dependencies.
```sh
npm install
```

### Setting up SGID
Create a new application at the [SGID Developer Portal](https://developer.id.gov.sg/), and use `http://localhost:1337/login` for the redirection URI.
Using the downloaded SGID credentials, create a `.env` file and populate it with the necessary SGID environment variables.

```sh
export SGID_CLIENT_ID="<your-sgid-client-id>"
export SGID_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-sgid-client-secret>"
export SGID_PRIVATE_KEY="<your-sgid-private-key>"
export SGID_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:1337/login"
```

Load the environment variables into your development container with
```sh
source .env
```

### Start your dev server
Start your app server in the VSCode terminal.

```sh
npm run dev
```
The application should be accessible at http://localhost:1337.
